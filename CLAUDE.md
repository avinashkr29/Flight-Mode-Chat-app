# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a new website project for a "Flight Mode Chat app" that is currently in its initial setup phase. The repository contains minimal structure with only a basic Readme file.

## Current State

- **Project Type**: Not yet determined (no package.json, framework files, or build configuration present)
- **Development Setup**: Not established
- **Build System**: Not configured
- **Testing Framework**: Not set up
- **Code Architecture**: Not defined

## Development Workflow

Since this is a new project, the following steps should be taken before implementing features:

1. **Choose Technology Stack**: Determine the frontend framework (React, Vue, Angular, vanilla JS, etc.)
2. **Initialize Package Manager**: Set up package.json with appropriate dependencies
3. **Configure Build Tools**: Set up bundler (Vite, Webpack, etc.) and development server
4. **Establish Project Structure**: Create directory structure for components, assets, styles, etc.
5. **Set Up Development Scripts**: Define npm/yarn scripts for dev, build, test, and lint

## Future Development

Once the project structure is established, this file should be updated to include:
- Build and development commands
- Testing procedures
- Code architecture and component structure
- Deployment process
