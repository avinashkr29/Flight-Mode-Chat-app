                    <h2>Privacy-First Design</h2>
                    <p>Flight Mode Chat is built with privacy as its foundation. Unlike traditional messaging apps that rely on servers and cloud infrastructure, our app uses direct Bluetooth connections between devices, ensuring your conversations stay completely private.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="privacy-section">
                    <h2>Data We DON'T Collect</h2>
                    <p>Because Flight Mode Chat works entirely offline using Bluetooth connections, we don't collect or store:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your messages or conversation history</li>
                        <li>Your location or travel information</li>
                        <li>Your contacts or phone number</li>
                        <li>Your personal information or profile data</li>
                        <li>Usage analytics or behavioral data</li>
                        <li>Device identifiers for tracking</li>

                <section class="privacy-section">
                    <h2>How Your Data is Protected</h2>
                    <h3>Local Device Storage Only</h3>
                    <p>All messages are stored locally on your device and are never transmitted to our servers or any third-party services. When you delete the app, all conversation history is permanently removed.</p>
                    
                    <h3>End-to-End Encryption</h3>
                    <p>All messages sent through Flight Mode Chat are encrypted using industry-standard encryption protocols before being transmitted via Bluetooth. Only the intended recipient can decrypt and read your messages.</p>
                    
                    <h3>No Server Infrastructure</h3>
                    <p>Flight Mode Chat operates without any server infrastructure. There are no central servers storing your data, no cloud backups, and no remote access to your conversations.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="privacy-section">
                    <h2>Bluetooth and Device Discovery</h2>
                    <p>To enable device discovery and messaging, Flight Mode Chat uses your device's Bluetooth functionality:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We create a temporary, anonymous identifier for your device that changes regularly</li>
                        <li>No personal information is broadcast during device discovery</li>
                        <li>Other users only see a generic display name you choose</li>
                        <li>Bluetooth connections are automatically terminated when you close the app</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section class="privacy-section">
                    <h2>Information Sharing</h2>
                    <p>We do not share, sell, or distribute any personal information because we don't collect any. The only data shared is:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Messages you explicitly choose to send to other users via Bluetooth</li>
                        <li>Your chosen display name (which you can change at any time)</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section class="privacy-section">
                    <h2>In-App Purchases and Subscriptions</h2>
                    <h3>Premium Subscriptions</h3>
                    <p>Flight Mode Chat offers premium subscription tiers that unlock additional features. These subscriptions are processed through Apple's App Store and are subject to Apple's terms and privacy policies.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Subscription Data</h3>
                    <p>When you purchase a subscription:</p>

                        <li>Payment is processed entirely by Apple - we never see your payment information</li>
                        <li>Apple provides us with anonymous subscription status (active/inactive) only</li>
                        <li>No personal or payment data is shared with us</li>
                        <li>Your subscription can be managed through your Apple ID settings</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>RevenueCat Integration</h3>
                    <p>We use RevenueCat, a third-party service, to manage subscription status and deliver premium features. RevenueCat processes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Anonymous subscription status from Apple</li>
                        <li>Device-specific identifiers (not linked to personal information)</li>
                        <li>Subscription tier and expiration information</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>RevenueCat does not collect or store your personal information, messages, or device data. Learn more about RevenueCat's privacy practices at <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy/" target="_blank">revenuecat.com/privacy</a>.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Auto-Renewal and Cancellation</h3>
                    <p>Premium subscriptions automatically renew unless canceled at least 24 hours before the current period ends. You can cancel your subscription at any time through your Apple ID settings. No refunds are provided for unused portions of subscriptions.</p>

                <section class="privacy-section">
                    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
                    <p>Flight Mode Chat minimally integrates with the following third-party services:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Apple App Store:</strong> For processing subscription payments and managing subscription status</li>
                        <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> For subscription management and premium feature delivery (see In-App Purchases section above)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We do not integrate with social media platforms, advertising networks, or analytics providers. Core messaging functionality works entirely independently on your device.</p>

                <section class="privacy-section">
                    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
